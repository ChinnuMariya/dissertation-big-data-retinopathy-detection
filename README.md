Master’s Dissertation: Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Deep Learning Developed a custom CNN and applied transfer learning models (InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201, Xception) to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images, focusing on performance, class imbalance, and overfitting control.
# 🧠 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Deep Learning

This repository contains the source code and report for my **Master's Dissertation** in **Big Data Management and Data Analytics**. The goal of this project is to detect diabetic retinopathy using retinal fundus images by leveraging deep learning and transfer learning models.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Built a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** from scratch
- Applied and fine-tuned **transfer learning models**:
  - ✅ InceptionResNetV2  
  - ✅ DenseNet201  
  - ✅ Xception
- Tackled **class imbalance** using data augmentation and oversampling
- Implemented **early stopping** and **dropout** to handle overfitting
- Compared model performance using metrics like:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC, and Confusion Matrix
